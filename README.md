# Deep-Learning-DTU

Final project for the deep learning course on DTU.

The jupyter notebook is called Distributed Reinforcement Learning and Large Scale Data Collection for Supervised Deep Learning Models.ipynb and can be seen here: https://github.com/Dadsgoosen/Deep-Learning-DTU/blob/master/Distributed%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20and%20Large%20Scale%20Data%20Collection%20for%20Supervised%20Deep%20Learning%20Models.ipynb

The files have the following structure:
 - ./Assets/.. Are all of the Unity C# files
 - Everything else if for the distributed framework, deep learning model training and so forth.
 - The CSV files are gathered using the distributed framework and are used for the training.
